                Hollywood puts “no face” on the Palestinian <br> experience. Mo Amer plans to change that

                <p class="text_tetle">When Mo Amer decided that he wanted to become a comedian There was never a
                    question about where he
                    might find the best material. After all, he grew up in Texas with the name Mohammed.
                </p><br>
                <p>Stories about his family’s assimilation pains, America’s warped view of Muslims and how chocolate
                    hummus is "a hate crime" have been spun into Amer's packed live shows, televised specials such
                    as
                    Netflix's "Mo Amer: The Vagabond" and his sets with the Allah Made Me Funny troupe. Now the
                    Palestinian American performer has poured his life into the semiautobiographical Netflix series
                    “Mo,” a new eight-part comedy he co-created with Ramy Youssef.
                </p><br>
                <p>The show follows a Muslim immigrant named Mo (played by Amer, of course) who was born in Kuwait
                    and
                    raised in working-class Houston, where he still lives with his mother and brother. Mo has been
                    awaiting asylum since they all arrived in the U.S. when he was 9. The fear of being caught by
                    Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the pride he has in his misunderstood Palestinian heritage
                    and
                    the universal longing to fit in are the springboard for a bittersweet comedy that dares to
                    venture
                    into dark emotional territory.
                </p><br>
                <p>The real Mo is a lot like the fictional one: He speaks English, Arabic and Spanish, loves hip-hop
                    and
                    at one point sold knockoff designer fashions from the trunk of his car to survive. Today,
                    however,
                    Amer has a booming stand-up career, his own show and a role in the upcoming DC superhero film
                    “Black
                    Adam.” The 41-year-old performer spoke with The Times about what it took to make the first-ever
                    Palestinian American sitcom. (The following has been edited for length and clarity.)f

                    Your character, Mo, is Houston through and through. He’s loves the city, the food, the people.
                    He
                    listens to local rappers. He drinks lean. But he’s also an immigrant, and that’s a huge part of
                    his
                    story. He presents a unique combo for a comedy series.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Yes, and he has a painstakingly long immigration story. But in reality, it’s every man’s story.
                    I
                    don't want to be corny, but it's a story of struggle, a story of identity. It’s a story of
                    wanting
                    to fit in and feel cool. It has all these layers in it where really anybody can truly connect
                    with
                    it. You don't have to be an Arab or Palestinian or Muslim or Christian. It doesn't matter. That
                    was
                    the intent of the show and that's usually what the response is when someone hears my own story —
                    they feel very empathetic towards it and relate to it in some way.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Yet your Palestinian heritage factors hugely into the series. Mo loves his mom’s hand-pressed
                    olive
                    oil. He makes jokes that he should be good at throwing rocks. His family is stateless and he's
                    haunted by the torture his late father suffered when displaced in Kuwait.
                </p><br>

                    I tip my hat to my mentor Danny Martinez, who always told me to write universal and be
                    universal. It
                    doesn't mean be hacky or boring. No, it means being grounded in your own perspective and culture
                    but
                    having that nuance. Where it’s truly universal is where the magic trick is.
